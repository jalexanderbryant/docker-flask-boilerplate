# docker-flask-boilerplate
## What 
A(n) (opinionated) container-based boilerplate for flask applications. 
## Why
Containers allow me to create applications in the way I visualize them mentally. Example: UIs should be as decoupled from backend APIs as possible. As much as I love Flask, I don't enjoy using Jinja templates. Setting up the UI as a seperate services lets me focus on each component of the application independently. I can also swap tools in and out as I see fit.

# Disclaimer:
This template was created as I learned containerization and their best practices; I am still adding improvements over time. In the meantime, use at your own discretion.
